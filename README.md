# Python Jump Start

## Create an environment

Python environments like Conda or PyEnv are crucial for managing dependencies, ensuring project isolation, and facilitating reproducibility across different development and production systems.

There are many ways to configure an environment. I will use [`conda`](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/).

1. `conda create --name pjs python=3.12`
2. `conda activate pjs`

We will do the rest of our installs from within a jupyter notebook.

## Git

We use `git` and Git Hub to manage version control while working.

## Data

Data is in this repo in a folder named `data`.

## VS Code & Jupyter

There are many ways to run Jupyter Notebooks. I will be using VS Code.

Here is some documentation on doing this: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks

## ChatGPT

I used ChatGPT while preparing and will use it during our session. Here is a link to me creating one of the datasets
we will use: https://chat.openai.com/share/74974b53-0ded-4d25-8348-8b966249f8c2

## Github Copilot

I am also using a tool called Github Copilot.

## Agenda

1. Using `pandas` to plot time series data.
2. Latent-Semantic Analysis
3. Semantic Embeddings with Open AI.
